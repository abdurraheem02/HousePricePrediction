Data
The project uses the 'Bengaluru_House_Data.csv' dataset, containing information about houses in Bengaluru.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant columns.

Feature Engineering
New features, such as 'bhk' and 'price_per_sqft,' are created to enhance the dataset's predictive power.
Outlier Handling
Outliers in the 'price_per_sqft' feature are identified and removed using a location-based approach.

Data Visualization
Data visualizations, including scatter plots and histograms, help gain insights into the data distribution and relationships.
