# HousePricePrediction
Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The project covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, outlier handling, model selection, and evaluation. The final model can assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions regarding property transactions in Bengaluru's real estate market.

Data
The project uses the 'Bengaluru_House_Data.csv' dataset, containing information about houses in Bengaluru.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant columns.

Feature Engineering
New features, such as 'bhk' and 'price_per_sqft,' are created to enhance the dataset's predictive power.
Outlier Handling
Outliers in the 'price_per_sqft' feature are identified and removed using a location-based approach.

Data Visualization
Data visualizations, including scatter plots and histograms, help gain insights into the data distribution and relationships.

Model Building
Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree Regression models are implemented and fine-tuned for predicting house prices.

Model Evaluation
Model performance is assessed through cross-validation, and the best-performing model is selected.
